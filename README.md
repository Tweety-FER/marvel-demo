# Marvel Demo Application

A simple demo application for viewing the cool stuff made at Marvel, developed
using React and Mobx.

You can use it to view comics, characters, and the ties that bind them.

## After cloning

After cloning the application, don't forget to run

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run the application in development mode (and make it watch changes)
by running

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building the application

You can build the application by running

```bash
npm run build
```

After that, the application will be available in the `/build` directory.
From that point on, you can run it by navigating there in the terminal and running
something like `http-server`, or just double-clicking on the `HTML` file.
